This contains the main fits data file from the set of observations taken 
with the Goodman spectrograph.  The original files are compressed with a 
primary header containing the basic information for the exposure, (see 
`../COMP_GDMN_DATA/Readme') but the pipeline cannot process that type of 
file properly, so I split them up.
