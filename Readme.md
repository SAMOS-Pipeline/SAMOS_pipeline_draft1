# SAMOS Data Reduction pipeline
Written by Dana Koeppe, Michigan State University 2016-present


Development is still in progress, but if you have questions or would like to make suggestions, please email Dana Koeppe at `koeppeda@msu.edu`.

PREREQUISITS:
The SAMOS DRP is written in python3.7 and is based heavily on the Goodman Spectroscopic Pipeline (see https://goodman.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), and makes use of the tools available with Astropy's image reduction package `ccdproc` (https://ccdproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  The accompanying environment file is `SAMOSenv.yml` and contains these packages and others necessary for using the pipeline.
